# Designing CRISPR Cas9 Library for Screening lncRNAs for Colorectal Cancer

In this project, we conducted an analysis of the human genome using the GENCODE project. Our aim was to identify potential targets for CRISPR-based gene editing in the context of cancer research. We imported the genome data, created BED files for protein-coding genes and epithelial intervals, and performed intersection analysis using bedtools. We also analyzed unique genes and transcripts, generated plots and a Venn diagram, and began the analysis of sgRNAs. Furthermore, we converted CRISPick results to BED format and performed a TSS distance analysis. Overall, our findings provide valuable insights for potential CRISPR-based gene editing strategies in cancer research.
